\section{Methodology}

The major methodology for this project centers on simulation
development. Background research is needed to provide a knowledge base
for adding capabilities to an existing simulation model and as such
the major task is the actual development of these additional features
as noted in the description.

\section{Progress to Data}

With the recent formation and meeting of the group, we are at various
levels of completion regarding the readings. Regular meeting times
have been set to Wednesdays at 2:30 pm. The progression is addressed
later in the timeline section.

\section{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
\item Project proesentation
\item Project report
\item Simulator with supplemented features
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Regarding timing
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Our presentation time will be in the last week of April,
    should this change the schedule will need to be amended.
  \item That there will be adequate time after classes end and exams
    start to finish the report.
  \end{itemize}
\item That the additional features are limited in scope as noted in
  the description section.

\item That the existing state of the simulator is of satisfactory
  quality and can be relied on to generally “work as described”.

\item That the work involved in adding the features noted in the
  description is of a reasonable amount both for the instructor to
  expect of the students and the students to expect to perform for a
  grade.
\end{itemize}
